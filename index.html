                After downloading the Python Program you'll need several python modules installed in order to make use of the program. As well as python 3.10, versions higher than 3.10 aren't guaranteed to work properly with pyaudio.
                A quick installer script can be downloaded on this page which will automatically installed the required depenencies for you to run the program and start recording!

                In order to make use of GPU processing you'll need a Nvidia CUDA capable GPU as well as nvidia cuda toolkit installed and a gpu enabled version of pytorch installed, if you dont install these the program will use CPU only mode which is slower but will still work.

                This program is configured to use 4 CPU worker threads along with a CUDA enabled GPU to provide real time audio transcription and transformations to extract speech from LRAD or Microwave Auditory Effect devices, 4 worker threads should work on an nvidia GPU with 4GB of dedicated VRAM, if you
                have lower vram than 4GB simply reduce the number of workers (NUM_WORKERS) in the program on line 35, using 1 worker will mean somewhat slower processing but lower VRAM requirements.

              <p>
                This program should empower individuals going through similiar harassment to record and gather real time audio data validating their claims that they were in fact victims of audio harassment/torture techniques.
